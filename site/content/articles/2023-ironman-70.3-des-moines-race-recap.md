## Race Recap

### Race Venue

IRONMAN 70.3 Des Moines is not an event I would consider racing if I was not living in Iowa. The race starts with a murky, urban swim in Gray's Lake followed by a erratic bike course on poorly paved roads. The run was by far the best leg, which comprised a short, 2-loop course along the Des Moines River colmindating with a finish in downtown Des Moines.

### Race Training

I targeted IRONMAN 70.3 Des Moines as my A race of the year and developed a 10 weeks training block in the lead up.

### Race Prep

My goal for this race was 4:40:00 (15 minutes faster than my personal best at 2022 IRONMAN 70.3 Texas). To do this, I set the following split goals:
* Swim: 00:32:00
* Bike: 02:20:00
* Run: 01:38:00

This would leave me a very generous 10 minutes for transition.

Using my [swim](https://nickolaskraus.io/articles/swimming-speed-and-paces/), [bike](https://nickolaskraus.io/articles/cycling-speed-and-paces/), and [run](https://nickolaskraus.io/articles/running-speed-and-paces/) pace tables, I calculated that I would need to have the following paces:
* Swim: 1:31/100yd (1:40/100m)
* Bike: 24.0 mph (38.6 kph)
* Run: 7:29/mi (~4:39/km)

In a race simulation, where I [biked 60 mi.](https://connect.garmin.com/modern/activity/11115848550) and [ran 14 mi.](https://connect.garmin.com/modern/activity/11116800889), I know I can hold ~205W for a 70.3 distance and still run at goal 70.3 pace. This would, however, be my fastest bike split to date, so I plan to race to power and do my best to be as fast as possible.

#### Swim Prep

Given my goal of 32 minutes on the swim, I set an alert on my watch for 16 minutes. If I am on pace, I should be at the third turn buoy at 16 minutes.

#### Bike Prep

Likewise, I have an activity profile on my Garmin bike computer specifically for IRONMAN 70.3. A custom data screen shows average speed, average power, and average heart rate. Similarly, auto lap is enabled for every 14 mi. The banner shows the same three metrics for the current lap.

#### Run Prep

All the best run splits from Kona to marathon world records are done with a negative split. That is, the second half of the distance is completed faster than the first. As such, I have an auto lap configured for my run at 6.55. Halfway through the half marathon, I will assess my current condition and pick up the pace. The goal is to get to this point in a condition where I have the capacity to negative split the half.

I followed this schedule almost perfectly, however, I decided to substitute a Drink Mix bottle for a bottle of water, which I didn't end up drinking.

### Swim
At every race, I learn something. Whether it be in regard to nutrition, execution, preparation, etc. This time I learned that no matter the circumstances, always bring a wetsuit. The Friday before the race, I was told that the water temperature was 77°F (wetsuit optional), however, on race day morning the temperature was 75°F (wetsuit permitted). When I rocked up to the swim start, I was one of the only athletes without a wetsuit. This error probably cost me a top 5 finish, since I would have easily swum 2-3 minutes faster. Lesson learned.

Regardless, my swim was still good. I need to remind myself that 1:40 min/100m in the pool ≠ 1:40 min/100m in open water.

So I never forget, here are the IRONMAN wetsuit temperature restrictions:

|                |                                             |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Mandatory**  | `<60.8°F` (`<16.0°C`)                       |
| **Permitted**  | `≤76.1°F` (`≤24.5°C`)                       |
| **Optional**   | `>76.2°F`, `≤83.8°F` (`>24.5°C`, `≤28.8°C`) |
| **Prohibited** | `>83.8°F` (`>28.8°C`)                       |

**NOTE**: Athletes who choose to wear a wetsuit in water temperatures 76.2°F to 83.8°F (24.5°C to 28.8°C) will not be eligible for Age Group awards, including World Championship or Rolldown slots.

### Bike

I was impressed with my bike. I have always been strong on the bike, but my upgraded setup translated my power into speed. In a [race simulation session](https://connect.garmin.com/modern/activity/11115848550) a few weeks prior, I managed to push 204W for approximately 2 hours and 30 minutes. I reasoned that I should be able to hold 205W average for the bike leg, which I executed flawlessly. I ended up with 203W average, 213W normalized.
