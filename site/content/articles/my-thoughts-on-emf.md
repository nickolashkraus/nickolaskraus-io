The danger of electromagnetic fields (EMF) has been ardently purported by holistic health types for several years. Such claims may have originated from epidemiological studies showing a link between one's proximity to power lines and adverse health outcomes. Foregoing the obvious limitations and confounding variables inherent in such studies, let's approach the issue of EMF from a mathematical perspective.

In short, one shouldn't be concerned with EMF exposure. We are literally bathing in EMF every time we go outside in the sun.

Radiation that one should avoid is ionizing radiation, that is, subatomic particles or electromagnetic waves that have sufficient energy to ionize atoms or molecules by detaching electrons from them. Such radiation has the potential to damage DNA leading to mutations that can cause cancer. Radio and microwave radiation is non-ionizing.

It should be noted that the energy of a wave (particle) is inversely proportional to its wavelength:

```
E = hc/位

h = Planck constant
c = 3 * 10^8 m/s (speed of light)
位 = wavelength
```

For reference visible light is between 310 nm and 1100 nm. Radiowaves are ~1 m.

```
位 = c/f

f = frequency
c = 3 * 10^8 m/s (speed of light)
位 = wavelength
```

As an example, let's take 5G. 5G operates at frequencies of about 28 GHz and 39 GHz. Using the formula above, that's about 1 mm to 0.76 mm. This is significantly longer than visible light. Given that the longer the wavelength, the lower the energy, electromagnetic radiation emanating from these sources is less than that of visible light.

Furthermore, the energy given off by a source of an electromagnetic field is inversely proportional to the square of the radius. So the energy dissipates exponentially.

In conclusion, nature simply does not dictate that EMF originating from smart phones, electronics, or cell towers should have deleterious affect on your health.
