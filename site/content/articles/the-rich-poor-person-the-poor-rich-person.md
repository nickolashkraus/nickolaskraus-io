description: Two types of people who fail to realize the utility of money and deploy it in order to better their lives.

I want to start this article with a brief story:

<blockquote class="prose" style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 25px; padding-right: 100px">
When on vacation as a child I found a milkshake drink that I was particularly fond of. So much so in fact that instead of drinking them or sharing them with my siblings, I hoarded them.
<br><br>
Every time my family went to the store, I would acquire these milkshake drinks, ferret them home, and store them in the back of the freezer, so that no one would find them.
<br><br>
I would check on them throughout the day, marveling at all the delicious flavors, and savoring the thought of consuming them.
<br><br>
Then we went home. I forgot to drink my milkshakes. I didn't even bring them with me. I never got around to experiencing the milkshakes because I was too invested in acquiring more of them.
</blockquote>

Substitute *milkshakes* for *money* and you have a higher-order situation most people find themselves: Too obsessed with the acquisition of a good to ever realize its utility or value.

## The Rich Poor Person, The Poor Rich Person

I've identified two types of people when it comes to money who fall into this trap:
* The Rich Poor Person
* The Poor Rich Person

Both are poor capital allocators, but for different reasons and both fail to deploy their money in order to improve their happiness and well-being.

## The Rich Poor Person

The *Rich Poor Person* is wealthy by any standard measure. They own stock and other securities, they have durable assets (land, real estate), and have multiple streams of income. They are usually self-made. Nevertheless, they fail to understand why they are wealthy, deferring to the simple equation of cash in minus cash out. These types of people are usually intelligent and hard working, but unimaginative and close-minded. Above all, they ignore the utility of money and do not understand power laws and therefore only think linearly about wealth and what it can do for them.

Additionally, money is their sole indicator of success. In a business sense, their only performance metric is income with an overemphasis on the *expenses* term of the income equation (income = revenues â€“ expenses). For this reason, they end up as middling millionaires, struggling with the same tired problems of people far less wealthy. They go through life applying the cash in, cash out equation to every circumstance and do not see the outsized return on investment of strategical capital allocation both in improving their lives and exponentially increasing their wealth.

As a final observation, [cheap millionnaire]

## The Poor Rich Person

The *Poor Rich Person* usually comes into money quickly and therefore does not have the experience to use it wisely or strategically. The stereotype of the lottery winner who blows their entire windfall on material stupidities and ends up worse than when they started may apply here. However, this type of person may also have no concept of how money can be deployed to make their lives easier and more enjoyable or its ability to unlock new and exciting opportunities. They say, "I have so much money, but I don't feel rich!". Here is the primary problem. A lifetime of squeaking by, not using money strategically to better their lives, not understanding the things that money can do to enrich their lives, has caused a disconnect between what money is and what money enables. Money enables a lifestyle and a way to moving through the world in which the problems that money can solve are done so instantly. "$75 Uber, $5 bottle of water, $35 to check my bag, don't care!" This mindset frees you of frivolous choices, allowing you to focus on what matters: meaningful work, meaningful relationships, a life lived to the fullest. This mindset also allows you to dream big, take risks, and seek out peak experiences. Having not thought or acted in this way, the poor rich person continues through life with no material increase in their standard of living, but with an extra zero or two in their bank account.

## Why do people come into this way of being?

First, I believe that this type of behavior arises from an inability for humans to think logarithmically. One does not get rich by saving money. Wealth is the result of constant, increasing success where the outcome is greater and greater reward. Wealth is also the increase in freedom, autonomy, and control, which begets greater opportunity, which begets even more wealth, a constant virtuous cycle.

But what about compounding interest?

Let me clear, the easiest way to become wealthy is for your money to work for you:

```
A = P (1 + r/n)^nt
```

* A = final amount
* P = initial principal balance
* r = interest rate
* n = number of times interest applied per time period
* t = number of time periods elapsed

Note, that I said *easiest*, not fastest. The fastest way to accrue wealth is to deploy in it such a manner that the return on investment far outpaces the typical market return. The paradox here is that given a big enough initial principal balance, one is already considered *wealthy* and therefore the need to increase one's return on investment in this way is not worth the time investment. This is why most wealthy people do not find accuring even more wealth appealing after having enough of it.

Second, I believe people are bad at evaluating the time, experience, money framework. Challenged with the hypothetical *"Would you rather be 20 and have $10,000 or 80 and have $1,000,000,000"* most everyone would choose the former. Given such a choice and still accounting for the likely decrease in the value one places on a single life year (year 20 > year 60), we can still estimate that on average one life year is worth somewhere between $100,000,000 and $150,000,000 to most people. Still most people are more than willing to waste their time and energy in order to safe a few bucks. Again, a discordance between reality and action that leads people in to fall into one of the above categories.

Thirdly, and, rather cynically, I think most people are too timid and too complacent to see money as anything other than another metric in their lives. They don't imagine themselves using the capital to build a company, travel the world, or fully maximize the panoply of peak experiences out there. They are content to live lives of quiet desperation.

## A Solution

Money is inert. It will not motivate you, make you happy, or solve life's challenging problems. For all intents and purposes, the amount of money you have is totally decoupled from your well-being except when you are in extreme poverty. Your currency, your *real* currency is based on your neurology. Whether you are happy or sad, energetic or lethargic, motivated or depressed all depends on the chemical processes inside your brain. Nothing else matters, literally. With this realization, it is hard to see money as anything other than a tool for modulating this system. Done correctly, this can yield an elevated feeling of well-being, peace of mind, security, and equanimity. However, this takes practice. It takes the conscientiousness to know what you want, the rationality to value money appropriately, and the higher-order thinking to be able to utilitize it to maximize your happiness. This does not mean profligate spending on all manner of materialistic junk (which is basically trading one asset class for another with zero gain in happiness, well-being, etc.), it means being highly judicious in deploying cash to live your best life and having a principled approach to how you view cash flow in, cash flow out, and capital investment in yourself and those you love.
