A review of my trip to Japan.

Until you experience Japan for yourself, it is hard to convey the unique
splendor it arouses. Tokyo, Japan's largest city, is at once a bustling
cityscape with all the trappings of urbanization, while also an oasis of
sprawling gardens and lush flora. This juxtaposition is played throughout the
city and its surroundings, offering a harmonizing medley of modernization and
nature. The streets are often lined with manicured *kuromatsu*, or Japanese
black pine, a species native to Japan, and public areas and walkways are
usually adorned with vibrant flowerbeds. This is of a piece with the overall
cleanliness of the city. Many of the streets are absolutely immaculate and it
is not uncommon to see the proprietor of a restaurant or business tidying up
the area outside their establishment[^1].

Such zeal for cleanliness does not stop at the threshold; rather, it
intensifies when entering the home. The house is treated as sacred, piety takes
the form of sacraments in orderliness. For example, one does not wear shoes in
the house and if one chooses to wear house slippers, said house slippers shall
*not* be worn in the bathroom.

The bathroom is another holy place in Japanese culture. A testament to Japan's
technological advancement and almost neurotic desire for cleanliness, they
represent a halcyonic confluence of Japanese proclivities. Infamous are the
Toto toilets, which can be found even in public restrooms and are an excellent
accoutrement to the bathroom experience. One need not know how to read
Japanese to partake in a ritual butt-washing, since, as with most instructions
in Japan, functionality is conveyed via subtle pictography.  (A dotted water
jet striking a pair of aesthetically curved half-moons that provide an artful
facsimile of the human buttocks, for example). Positioning and pressure are
also configurable to accommodate the power user[^2].

Toilets aside, what I found most astonishing was the general sense of safety.
Children starting at 5 years of age can be seen taking the subway to and from
school or meandering their way down busy sidewalks. This was completely foreign
to me and accentuates the difference in perceived security of America and
Japan. This feeling of general safety is, from what I have gathered, an
outgrowth of a greater sense of community experienced in Japan. This makes
sense from a biological evolutionary standpoint. When the group is superior to
the individual, it follows that harm done to one, is harm done to all.

Placing the group above the individual is commonplace in Japan and is reflected
in their work culture as well. Teams consist of individuals, some with more or
less authority. The ultimate goal, however, is not one's personal advancement,
but the advancement of the team and the accomplishment of shared objectives.
Even as a red-blooded American who derives his grounding principles from
individualism, I cannot help but give credence to the power of national
identity giving rise to an expanded circle of concern.

Japan, like Germany, is a culture with which I am absolutely enamored. I plan
to return to Japan and in the meantime have endeavored to learn the language.

## Before You Go

**Download the Japan Travel app**

This [app](https://www.navitime.co.jp/pcstorage/html/japan_travel/english/)
makes navigating large cities (e.g., Tokyo or Kyoto) incredibly easy. Where
this app really shines is the route search, which gives accurate and timely
directions from your preferred point of departure to your destination.

**Get a Suica card**

A [Suica](http://www.jreast.co.jp/e/pass/suica.html) is a prepaid e-money card
for moving around and shopping in Japan. Simply load money onto the card and
scan it at points of entry or exit to automatically deduct the cost of your
fare from your balance.

**Bring an umbrella**

The weather in Japan can fluctuate wildly over the course of the day. Having an
umbrella on hand, or buying one there, is highly recommended. Like most
everything in Japan, the logistics of having 9 million people carrying
umbrellas on any given day have been scrupulously considered. Almost every
establishment has an area to securely store your sodden parasol.

## Things To Know

- Don't worry about restrooms. They are ubiquitous and very clean.
- Nigiri, a thin slice of raw fish over pressed vinegared rice should be picked
  up from the rice side, whether with your hands or chopsticks.
- People do not get going until 8AM or 9AM. If you want to experience something
  in peace and solitude, get going early.

## Places To See

### Tokyo

#### Meiji Jingu and Yoyogi Park

Located in Shibuya, Tokyo, this experience offers a beautiful and tranquil
stroll through the meandering paths of Yoyogi Park culminating in the imperial
Meiji Shrine.

#### Kabukicho

Wash your hands and try to forget the gaudy lasciviousness that is Kabukicho.
This is where most of the *tourists* come to be dazzled by cartoonish
attractions and cheap entertainment. This is not the best Tokyo has to offer.

#### Odaiba

Situated on Tokyo Bay, Odaiba offers a nice respite from the city and many live
events. There is *a lot* to see and do.

#### Tsukiji Market[^4]

Acute insomnia from a 14-hour time difference might enable you to be at the
fish auction by 5AM; however the fish market does not disappoint later in the
day. Tsukiji offers the freshest, most delicious sashimi in the world.

#### Ueno Park

The Peony Garden at Ueno Toshogu nestled in Ueno Park is truly beautiful in
May.

#### Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden

A perfect location for the serious florophile, this green space snaked with
paths and dotted with small ponds and shrines is exquisite.

### Kyoto

#### Arashiyama Bamboo Grove

Watching sunlight play softly off the leaves falling amidst towering bamboo is
truly surreal. There is a subtle magic and enchantment that pervades Arashiyama
and must be experienced. Again, get here early before the throngs of people
arrive.

#### Fushimi Inari Shrine

Luckily this experience requires a bit of physical exertion, so those of feeble
resolve quickly turn back, leaving the hallowed path to the summit unsullied.

#### Kinkaku-ji Temple

Beautiful, when not swamped with ogling tourists. Hit this one early in the day
to allow for some reflection. If not, you will be stuck in a jostling flow of
human cattle.

## Places To Eat

#### Torikizoku

Disregard the variable ratings on Google Reviews, this restaurant is actually
quite good. Even an orthorexic like myself could find something clean and
healthy to eat. Raw cabbage, tomatoes, chicken, and hard-boiled eggs are all on
the menu, all under ¥400. The beer is also great.

#### Ramen Zundou-ya

Simply the best ramen in Tokyo. Hands down. Full stop.

#### Jasmine Thai Yotsuya

Great lunch destination if you are in Yotsuya and have a hankering for Thai.
