Trials and tribulations of my 9-month job search in 2025.

+++

I started my job search on December 24th, 2024[^1]. The process concluded
September 12th, 2025. That's 262 days of applying to jobs, grinding LeetCode,
sweating interviews, frustration, elation, success, and failure. This post
details the trials and tribulations of my 9-month job search and what I learned
along the way.

## Overview

In all, I put 340 hours[^2] into the process. This time was bucketed into
5 categories:
* Searching for jobs
* Applying to jobs
* Interview prep (LeetCode, system design, behavioral, etc.)
* Interviewing
* Organizing[^3]

I received 2 offers, 25 rejections, and withdrew from 4.

### Searching for jobs

Honestly, my job search methodology was not scientific; open LinkedIn, skim
jobs. I also just slowly gathered information around interesting companies and
aggregated information via [Blind][Blind], [Glassdoor][Glassdoor], and other
platforms. This gave me a general feeling for companies/opportunities to pursue
and not pursue. In my day-to-day (reading, podcasts, etc.), if I came across
a company that sounded cool, I applied[^4].

### Applying to jobs

Applying to jobs takes a lot of time since it involves reading countless job
descriptions, filling in personal information, and providing answers to the
same voluntary self-identification questions over and over again. In my
experience, manually applying to jobs had minimal ROI[^5], as almost all of my
applications were rejected. The only real advice I have on this front is to
just use a Google Doc for your resume, since companies use Applicant Tracking
Systems (ATS) to parse resumes. The easier it is for these systems to
coherently parse your resume, the more likely your application will pass an
initial screen.

### Interview prep

Oh, Lord. I spent hundreds of hours grinding LeetCode ([grind.rip][grind.rip]).
This occurred mostly on weekends and in the early morning, but also during my
work hours (sorry Workiva). It became a second job and at my peak I was
clocking 20-hour weeks of purely interview prep. Again, the more time and
energy you put into preparing for the technical portion of the interview, the
better you will do. I only ended up getting through ~50% of the material
I wanted to cover, but since it's impossible to know what type of coding
questions you will get, your best bet is to just go as deep and broad as
possible[^6].

### Interviewing

In all, I spent close to 40 hours actually interviewing. For me, this process
was exhausting, as my day centered around the adrenaline spike and long come
down from the process, effectively destroying my productivity and mood for the
day. Since I work from home, I did not need to scuttle off to an empty
conference room like my RTO comrades, but it was challenging all the same,
especially on top of actually doing my job.

Generally, and I feel like a broken record at this point, the more you
interview, the better you get across all domains (coding, communication,
eloquence, etc.). Therefore, you should spend a considerable amount of time
just interviewing in order to get better at it. Write down the questions,
reflect on what went well, and be prepared to bomb[^7].

### Organizing

I ended up with a 36 page Google Doc with every interaction I had with
a company, all my notes, reflections, etc. This proved extremely useful when
organizing interview applications at various points in the process. It also
served as a dumping ground for all the information I picked up along the way.
In all, this was about 10 hours of work, but was crucial for giving me a sense
of control.

## Insights

### Elevator Pitch

You will be asked about your background. *A lot*. You should be able to recite
your elevator pitch perfectly, tailoring it to the specific audience.

Here was mine:

```
I am a Senior Software Engineer on the Platform Operations team, where I lead
a team of 5 engineers that is responsible for the software development
lifecycle at Workiva.

I build software that allows engineering teams to deploy code to production
safely and reliably 1000s of times per day.

Some of the projects I've led recently are a distributed caching and storage
system and Workiva's first AI platform that allows teams to deploy LLM-based
solutions to production.

I am currently working on...

I am passionate about joining...
```

Make sure to emphasize the reason you are interested in joining whatever
company you're interviewing with. Companies want to hear that you are aligned
with their mission.

### Burner Companies

The first few interviews will be rough. You'll probably end up sounding
unprepared and incoherent. But by the end of the process you will be incredibly
smooth. I was amazed at the difference between my early interviews and my later
interviews. I sounded incredibly professional (at least that is what I tell
myself). For this reason you should take interviews at undesirable companies
just to get the reps in before you shoot your shot with a company you are
passionate about.

### Stories

A compelling story in STAR format is the foundation of a good interview. Learn
STAR format and write and rehearse. Over and over. Make sure you emphasize
**your** contribution and what **you** did.

The STAR format is as follows:
* **S**ituation
* **T**ask
* **A**ction
* **R**esult

### Failure

Be prepared to fail. *A lot*. Be prepared to get a lifetime's worth of flush
letters. After the 5th rejection or so, I felt nothing.

### Coding

One thing I realized is, in live coding exercises the problems aren't that hard
(at least for the companies I interviewed with). You just need to be able to
type fast and get a solution.

In addition, interviewers are using AI-resistant techniques to suss out
cheaters. So you still have to know your shit.

### Wayne Gretzky Mindset

So cliche and banal, but I'm putting it here anyway:

>You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.

You *have* to be active. Apply. Reach out. Quantity is a quality of its own.

As a personal anecdote, I was interviewing with two companies (both of which
I ended up getting offers from), but preferred one over the other. I wanted to
bail on the interview process at one of the companies. My wife (God love her),
said to stick it out and do the interviews. This turned out to be wildly good
advice because not only did I get an offer from the company, I also ended up
almost joining the company over my preferred choice. In the end, I was able to
use the offer as leverage to get a much higher TC from my preferred company.

### Energy Management

One of the most difficult aspects of interviewing is the manic, schizophrenic
nature of your days balancing life, interviews, and work. This was hard. As
I alluded to earlier, days in which I had interviews consisted of a crescendo
of excited energy followed by a crash of fuzzy rumination. These days usually
were unproductive and I was more irritable. This only worsened when I got to
the final stages of interviewing, which added the neurotic email checking to
the blend of negative valenced activity[^8].

### Conclusion

I'm not extremely intelligent[^9]. What I possess is a grit and determination
that allows me to keep showing up day after day even after months of failure.
Hard work *will* pay off. You just don't know when. Keep pushing and keep
grinding.

[^1]: Yes, on Christmas Eve.
[^2]: I track all my work related activity using [Toggl][Toggl].
[^3]: I ended up with a 36 page Google Doc detailing the entire process.
[^4]: I remember the exact location I was when I heard an ad for [Function
Health][Function Health], the company I ended up joining, on the Huberman
Podcast.
[^5]: The only real traction I got during the process was via LinkedIn
recruiters and direct contacts. With millions of AI generated applications and
slop resumes, applying through a company's website is almost useless.
[^6]: The coding interview process is kind of crazy. You're expected to know
a broad swath of computer science theory, but also the most esoteric algorithms
for solving specific problems. Rest assured, outside of the top FAANG
companies, and increasing due to cheating with AI, you probably won't get
a bespoke LeetCode problem. In my experience, most of the coding interviews
I did touched lightly on algorithms and focused more heavily on practical
coding.
[^7]: I had an interview with [River][River], in which I said "I don't know."
to almost every question. It was very painful.
[^8]: For the two weeks leading up to accepting an offer, my sleep started
to suffer as well. I would frequently wake up at 2 AM, fully-alert and wired
and start the insidious cycle of perseveration.
[^9]: I'm not trying to be humble here. I am legitimately only strongly above
average.
