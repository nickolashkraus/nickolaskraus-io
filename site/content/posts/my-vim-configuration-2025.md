It's been a while since I've provided an update on my Vim configuration. *A
lot* has changed in the intervening 7 years.

plugins that I use.

## Configuration

My full Vim configuration file is [here][.vimrc].

[^1]: ALE is the
[spiritual successor](https://github.com/vim-syntastic/syntastic#1-deprecation-note)
of Syntastic.
[^2]: I disable all LSP integrations via ALE. I use YouCompleteMe instead.
[^3]: I disable automatic linting via vim-go. I use ALE instead.
[^4]: I love this plugin, since I often found myself manually aligning table
columns.
[^5]: Though YouCompleteMe has some of the fixing and linting features offered
by ALE, I use YCM purely for code completion.
[^6]: fzf is an incredibly powerful tool, but has a steep learning curve.
