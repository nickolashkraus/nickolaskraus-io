A lot of people boast about their 16-hour workdays[^1]. Typically, these people
do not even get close to 16 productive hours. In this post, I'll outline in
gory detail how I achieve 16-hour workdays.

First, let's set some ground rules and get some definitions clear. For one,
unless you are on amphetamines, you **cannot** work 16 hours per day. I'm
talking about butt in chair, focused work. You **can**, however, be productive
for 16 hours a day. Spread across health, work, and family you can sustainably
do impactful, high-value shit for 16 hours per day.

Second, let me define *productive*. Productive for me, is the act of producing
(better health, software, loving relationships, etc.). It is inherently active.
It is also the opposite of consumption, which is a passive act[^2]. Under this
definition, as long as the activity in which I'm partaking is in someway
enriching my human experience or the experience of those around me through *my*
action, I consider it productive, and by extension, broadly defined as work.
Ergo, a 16-hour workday is achieve if comprised of only those things, which can
be categorized using the hereto definition of *productive* (QED).

So, under these conditions, I can assert that I *work* 16 hours per day, saving
the remaining 8 hours for sleep. It should also be noted that I do this **every
day**. Weekends, holidays, and all throughout May.

## 4:00 (Morning Routine)

I start my day at 4:00 AM. Honestly, if you think 5:00 AM is *early*, I pity
you. You're already falling behind. In the first hour upon waking, I accomplish
the following:
- Brush Teeth (See: Oral Hygiene)
- Take Morning Supplements + Journal (See: Supplements)
- Do Chores

While I'm brushing my teeth, I'm heating 300 mL water to 185°F. I add the hot
water to 5 g creatine and add an extra 150 mL water[^3]. With this I take
my morning supplements. As I'm drinking my optimally calibrated water, I journal.
Journaling has been one of the single most impactful habits that I've started in
2025. I use the 5-minute Journal. Thereafter, I do the morning chores: make bed,
empty dishwasher, prep breakfast, feed the dog[^4].

Sometimes, I'll take a cool bath and shower.

## 5:00 (Exercise)

I used to train 2 hours every morning when I was racing triathlons, but with a
child and the demands of work, I limit myself to 1 hour per day.

## 6:00 (Getting Ready/Family Time)

After training, I take a shower and do my skincare routine. About this time, my
wife and daughter are awake and all bets are off with regard to my neurotic
adherence to my schedule. I'll usually play with my daughter, change her, and
do whatever miscellaneous things need to be done.

## 7:00 (Breakfast)

My breakfast has been the same for several months now and I make the same exact
meal for my wife. It is always:
- Eggs
- Avocado
- Kimchi
- Olive Oil
- Fruit (Kiwi, Blueberries, etc.)

I also take my supplements (Foundation + Energy/Focus).

## 8:00 (Work)

Work. My ideal workday is 8:00 - 16:00. One thing that I've started doing is
starting the day by getting organized and making a list of the things I want
to accomplish. It's so simple, but so effective[^5]. This is when I do my best
work, so this time is sacred.

## 12:00 (Lunch)

I used to take an hour or so I make a nice lunch, but I just don't have time for
that now. Also, I hate overeating at lunch, since it is bound to make be tired
in the afternoon. The trick is eating just enough to get me to dinner, but not
so much that I'm sleepy. Lunch is usually:
- Nuts (Walnuts, Macadamias, Cashews)
- Grass-fed Dried Beef
- Cheese
- Dried Fruit (Figs, Prunes)

After lunch, I take my dog, Remy, on a 20-minute walk[^6].

## 12:30 (Work)

Second work session. Usually worse than the morning session unless I'm really
interested in a topic or have a deadline. This is usually when my attention and
executive function starts to wane and why I think its bullshit when anyone says
they can work for >10 hours per day.

## 17:00 (Dinner)

My favorite part of the day. Sitting down, after a long day, with my wife and daughter,
eating good food, talking about the day, makes me so incredibly happy. We meal prep
on the weekends and will have one of the following:
- Salmon Bowl
- Beef Bowl
- Chicken Curry

## 18:00 (Night Routine)

It's kind of depressing, but after dinner, my focus largely preparing for the
next day. We go on a family walk, get our daughter ready for bed, read her a book,
then do the night chores. I brush my teeth, take a shower, do my skincare routine.

## 20:00 (Sleep)

My goal is to be in bed every night at 20:00 (8 PM, for you brainlets). I usually
read for 20-30 minutes before I pass out[^7]. This gives me 7-8 hours of sleep per night.

## Zero Consumption Policy

As you can see, I have zero time budgeted for mindless consumption. Sure, I listen
to podcasts, read articles, and watch YouTube, but the ROI of these activities
needs to be substantial. I have totally cut out all social media, since I always
regret the time I spend on it.

### Sleep

My goal is to get 7.5 hours of sleep per night. Given a 16 work day and 8 hour sleep window,
this allows for 30 minutes of sleep onset, which I usually spend reading. My sleep hygiene has
gotten so good that I regularly can fall asleep within 1-3 minutes.

Eye Mask
Mouth Tape
Silicon Earbuds
Cool Room (62F-65F)

### Diet

I've been honing my diet for years, but I think I've finally landed on **The
Best** diet for me. Plainly stated, this is an omnivorous diet, with
high-protein, low sugar, high fiber, fermented foods, and little to no dairy.

**Breakfast**  
- Eggs
- Avocado
- Kimchi
- Olive Olive
- Fruit (Kiwi, Blueberries, etc.)

**Lunch**
- Nuts (Walnuts, Macadamias, Cashews)
- Grass-fed Dried Beef
- Cheese
- Dried Fruit (Figs, Prunes)

**Dinner**

- Salmon Bowl
- Beef Bowl
- Chicken Curry

**NOTE**: I've given up desserts for a few months now. Honestly, I don't miss them

## Other Routines

**Skincare**

**Oral Hygiene**
**Brush Teeth**  
I have a 3-step oral hygiene routine, which has resulted in zero cavities,
zero plaque, minimal gum pockets, and, generally, healthy, white teeth.

1. Manual Brushing  
I use a bamboo tooth brush with a natural fluoride-free toothpaste.

2. Manual Flossing
I use a floss stick to remove any soft plaque.

3. Automatic Brushing
I use a electric tooth brush.

**Training**

 Exercise takes the form of one of the following:
- Run
- Stair Stepper
- Strength Training
- Bike
- Swim
- Yoga

I try to strength train 2-3x per week, then mix in endurance training 4-6x per week.
I also try to vary the training type to Zone 2, Threshold, and VO2 max.

I've also started using the sauna again, in which case I reallocate 20 minutes of
my training budget to a 20-minute sauna session (190F-210F).

### Reflections

After the birth of my daughter, I had an existential crisis. 

[^1]: Buckle up, because I'm about to boast about mine.
[^2]: Whenever I am consuming something, it is usually paired with a productive
activity (e.g., walking the dog and listening to a podcast).
[^3]: This, somehow, is the Goldilocks ratio for 100% dissolution of the creatine
and optimal drinkability temperature.
[^4]: I also find time to poop, though the timing is variable.
[^5]: Ironically, I tried doing this today, but ended up writing this post.
[^6]: Most days, one might witness a man deep in thought, powering around the
neighborhood with a big, slightly overheated English Creme Golden Retriever
in his wake. This is me.
[^7]: If I'm reading DFW, I can easily stay up until 11 PM.
[^1]: 4 g (2600 mg EPA, 640 mg DHA)
[^2]: 5,000 IU
