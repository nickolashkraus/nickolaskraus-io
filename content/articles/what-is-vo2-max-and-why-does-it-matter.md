## What is VO2 max?

VO2 max is the maximum rate of oxygen consumption one can achieve. The name corresponds to the following:
* **V̇** for volume (per unit of time)
* **O2** for oxygen
* **max** for maximum

Simply put, your VO2 max refers to the maximum rate at which your muscles can extract oxygen from your blood and put it to metabolic use to generate energy.

## How is VO2 max measured?

VO2 is calculated using the Fick equation:

```
VO2 = (CO x Ca) - (CO x Cv)
```

where,

* `CO` = Cardiac output
* `Ca` = Oxygen content of arterial blood
* `Cv` = Oxygen content of mixed venous blood

Ca – Cv (a-vO2 diff) represents arteriovenous oxygen difference, or the difference oxygen concentration of oxygenated blood and deoxygenated blood. As exercise intensities increases, the muscles increase the amount of oxygen they extract from the blood and this therefore increases in a-vO2 diff.

If we know the fractional portion of inhaled oxygen and we can measure the amount of exhaled oxygen, we can calculate oxygen consumption, or a-vO2 diff.

In order to determine the maximum oxygen consumption, exercise intensity is increased until oxygen volume plateaus

This represents the limit of your aerobic system. In other words, there’s a plateau—a point at which, even though you’re working harder, you’re not using any more oxygen. This limit is a physiological limit, not one of motivation or will.

Though VO2 max corresponds to the total amount of consumed oxygen per minute (L/min), it is conventional to divide this number by an individual's weight, yielding oxygen per minute per kilogram. This allows for values to be normalized for body size.

VO2 max is measured as liter per minute and is usually presented per kilogram of bodyweight (mL/min/kg).

## Why is VO2 max useful?

Your VO2 max is often used as an indicator of overall cardiorespiratory fitness and can serve as a metric for tracking progress.

One thing that sets VO2 max apart from other performance-based metrics is that it is governed by physiology, not motivation or willpower. Once the body can no longer utilzation the oxygen being brought into the body, VO2 will plateau. This plateau corresponds to an individuals maximum oxygen consumption (VO2 max). At this point the aerobic system has reached it's limit.

Likewise, VO2 max gives a more accurate approximation of one's health status. Of all the physiological parameters that one can measure, VO2 max may have the highest correlation with health simply due to the fact that the measures one must take to have a VO2 max (that is, performaing vigorious exercise) suggest that a person is physically and mentally very fit, thus serving as a good proxy for longevity.

## History

VO2 max was first introduced by Archibald Vivian Hill (A.V. Hill) in 1922. In the intervening years, VO2 max results have been measured for the histories greatest athletes:

## The highest VO2 max of all time

VO2 max is generally correlated with elite performance in endurance sports (running, cycling, cross-country skiing). Therefore, it particularly interesting when an individual comes along and sets the highest VO2 max in recorded history.

In August, 2012, an 18-year-old Norwegian cyclist named Oskar Svendsen recorded a VO2 max of 96.7 ml/kg/min. This after, recoding a VO2 max of 74.6 ml/kg/min as a relatively untrained apline skiier.

For context, having a VO2 max between 80-90 ml/kg/min puts you in the pantheon of histories endurance lengends:
| Athlete | Sport | VO2 Max |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Greg Lemond | Cycling | 92.5 |
| Matt Carpenter | Running (Ultra Marathon, Trail Runner) | 90.2 |
| Kilian Jornet | Running (Ultra Marathon, Trail, Sky Runner) | 89.5 |

* Kílian Jornet, 89.5
* Steve Prefontaine, 84.0

The previous VO2 max record holder was Bjorn Daehlie, arguablt the greatest cross-country skier of all-time. Daehlie alledgly tested at 96 in the late 90s. Besting the most successful male cross-country skier of all-time presaged a momumental cycling career for Svendsen, which he lived up to by becoming the junior cycling time trial (TT) World Champion following a just 3 years of training.

Oskar Svendsen, unfortunately, never reached cycling ascendency. Whether due to be pressure to perform given his physiological gift or simply due to a lack of interest, Svendsen retire from cycling at the age of 23 to return to university.

Nevertheless, his unworldly physiologic potentical is captured in a case study, which folowed Svendson during his brief cycling tenure:

## VO2 max and athletic performance

In sports where outcomes are dictated by the size of one's cardiovascular engine, does it stand to reason that the higher one's VO2 max, the better they will do? The answer is no. Unlink other performance metrics, such as watts per kilogram (W/kg) in cycling, VO2 max is not a clear indicator for athletic success.

VO2 max is not the end all be all of physiological performance, however. Said another way, you cannot simply line up all the competitors in a race and predict their finishing position purely based on their VO2 max.

Lance Armstrong, for example, had a comparatively pedestrian VO2 max for a grand tour cyclist. His gift was his ability to sustain a absurdly high percentage of VO2 max, up and above anaerobic threahold, for an absurdly long time.

## Why does it matter?

### Hazard ratio and risk reduction

>A hazard ratio is a measure of how often a particular event happens in one group compared to how often it happens in another group, over time.

In these studies, the hazard ratio was related to all-cause mortality. The hazard ratio for mortality is the reciprocal of the hazard ratio of risk reduction.
