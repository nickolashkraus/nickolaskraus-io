It's been a year since my original post ([What I Eat - Q2 2022](https://nickolaskraus.io/posts/what-i-eat-q2-2022/)). Let's revisit this topic to see what has changed and what has stayed the same.

## How I ate in 2022

Just to recap, my eating schedule in 2022 was as follows:
* 07:00 - Pre-Workout
* 09:00 - Post-Workout
* 12:00 - Lunch
* 17:00 - Dinner

## My current goals

Likewise, my goals have not changed:

>As a triathlete and software engineer, I need both physical and mental performance to be optimal throughout the day. This requires making some compromises such that neither is fully maximized at the detriment of the other. In addition, I want to reduce body fat, increase lean muscle, and ensure adequate hormone production, recovery, sleep, etc.. Admittedly, this is a difficult needle to thread. Nevertheless, I am approaching, what is for me, the ideal diet.

â€“ From *What I Eat - Q2 2022*

## Basic rules I follow

In 2022, I posited the following rules:
* Avoid vast within-day energy deficits or surpluses.
* Avoid fiber.
* Avoid FODMAPs.
* Avoid sugar.

In 2023, these principles have remained largely intact, however, I make a distinction between nutrition for performance and nutrition for health. To perform maximally, you need to take on carbohydrates. *A lot* of carbohydrates. For example, the upper limit the human body can absorb is 120g per hour. It is important to practice race nutrition, which means consuming sugar (glucose + fructose) during training. I typically only consume large amounts of simple carbohydrates in and around training.

Additionally, I have focused heavily on protein consumption. Ideally, 1g per pound bodyweight (or 2.2g per kilogram). This ensures optimal performance and recovery.

## Full day of eating

**NOTE**: Unless I am doing a hard training session (>1 hour or high-intensity), my first session of the day is usually fasted. This is usually a swim session, which I preferred to do on an empty stomach.

## Conclusion

I think 2022 me sums this up nicely,

>Though I am constantly experimenting, refining, and reworking what and when I eat, I have found that this diet optimizes both physical and mental performance throughout the day.
>
>It is important to be an astute observer of how certain foods affect your mood, energy, and performance. To this affect, it's helpful to keep a food diary and have at least a ballpark estimate of the calories and macronutrients you are consuming.

As such, it looks like I need to up my protein... ðŸ¥š
