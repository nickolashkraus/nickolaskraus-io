I have always marvelled at individuals who are able to keep it together when traveling. For most of my life, travel meant poor food, shit sleep, malaise and en nui, which would eventually spiral in self-sabtage, self-loathing, and regret.

I've traveled more than the average person. Many countries of Europe and Asia can

## Pre-flight Check

### Global Entry

First, if you do not have Global Entry, stop what you are doing and apply. Global Entry allows you skip customs when entering the US and grants you Pre-Check, which is a significantly faster than standard security. Nothing feels worse than beingn treated like another unwashed prole at 4 A.M. in the morning.

## Gear

I have to "go" kits, one for electronics, one for towletries. These are always stocked and ready to throw in my bag, reducing stress and the mental overhead of rememeber, for example, if I have that God-forsaken cable to that piece of extraneous tech.

## Supplements

Ever since I got massively sick on vacation, I've taken extra precautions to boost my immunity through exogenous chemicals. In addition, I tried to parse down my supplement stack to only those things that are necessary and we not be an encumnberance. Finally, I treat travel as a time to detox from the stimulants and nootropics I am using. Having this forced break ensures their potency over the long-term and since the novelty and excitment of travel is stimulating enough, stacking chemicals to further augment my physiology can (and has) led to a serious crash.

## Training

I always bring equiment to run and swim with me wherever I go. It is incredbility freeing to know that, if all else fails, I can throw on my Hoka's and go for a run.

* Swim Cap
* Swim Goggles
* Swim Breifs

* Running Shoes
* Running Socks, Shorts, Shirt, Hat

* Sports Watch
* Heart Rate Monitor

Yes, I am that fucking type A, nut who needs to wear an HRM for a undescript easy run.

Lately, I've been very attentive to my training load, while traveling. I always feel incredibly motivated at the start, go to hard, than get burned out or sick. The novelty and faux-machismo conjured by the thought of self as hyperdisciplined, world-traveling, fitness all-star can cause one to overreach (in an environment where sleep, nutrition, and recovery is already compromised). For this reason, I try to pan my training blocks such that travel falls during a recovery week. I don't overdo it anymore. I don't try to train off a little overindulgence. I let it hang out a little, enjoy life, and treat it as recovery.

## Morning Of

If I do not have to get up early for a flight, I stick to my normal routine and make sure I get a workout in. If I have to wake up super early, I'll expedite my routine. Here is what a typical early morning flight routine looks like:
* 3:00 - Wake
* 3:05 - Brush Teeth
